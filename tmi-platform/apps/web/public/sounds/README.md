# TMI Web App - Audio Files

This directory contains sound effects and background music for The Musician's Index.

## Required Audio Files

Create these audio files for full experience:

### Sound Effects
- `welcome.mp3` - Welcome stinger (2-3 seconds, upbeat 80s synth)
- `click.mp3` - UI click sound (short, sharp)
- `hover.mp3` - Hover sound (subtle, soft)
- `page-turn.mp3` - Magazine page flip sound (whoosh effect)

### Background Music
- `background-music.mp3` - Looping 80s synthwave (instrumental, 2-3 min loop)

## Placeholder Files

If audio files are missing, the app will still work (Howler.js handles missing files gracefully).

## Production

For production, optimize audio files:
- Format: MP3 (128kbps for effects, 192kbps for music)
- Size: <100KB for effects, <3MB for music
- Sample Rate: 44.1kHz
